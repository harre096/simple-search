### Tweak Idea 1
##### Flip a random bit. (flip-one-bit)
First we run the random generator n times, then use our hill climbing operator m times.
* We think that randomly exchanging one item for another may not be super effective, but should be a reasonable first mutator.
* Also, if we run random enough times up front, we should have a reasonalble hill to climb.
